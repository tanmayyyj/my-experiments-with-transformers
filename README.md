# Some sample stories
As Jack was walking home, he saw a big bottle lying on the ground. It was raining outside, so Jack couldn't get it out. He picked it up and put it back on his shelf.
Jack ran over to the water and grabbed the bottle. He ran back to his mom and put the bottle back on the shelf. She said, "Wow, this is so flexible!" Then she ran to it and said, "Emma, you did it!"
Jack's mom smiled and said, "Great! You're so talented at all! Now give a big key to keep looking!"
Jack smiled and said, "I'm going to do it! We can rest in the sandbox!"
And so Mom said, "Well done! That's a great job! I'm so glad I had enough toys!"
